# calender

//things i regret about this project:
//1- i didnt use a design pattern !
//2- i used date object as a string instead of date formate in notes
//3- as the feauters progress i end up with a spagheti code !
// FACT: it wouldn't be possible without the builtin date object "new Date()" thanks javascript !
